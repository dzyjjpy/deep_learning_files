All key steps to compiling protobuf(in order to install tencent ncnn, caffe, ...)
Protocbuf version is really important for later framework installation. E.g. ncnn requires 2.6.2 or higher protobuf

1. protobuf compiling installation

1.1 display protocbuf
  $ protoc --version # display protocbuf version
  $ which protoc  # find the protoc directory

1.2 uninstall existing protocbuf version
  $ which protoc  # find the protoc directory
  $ rm /usr/local/bin/protoc  # remove the installation package
  $ sudo apt-get remove libprotobuf-dev  # uninstall system's protobuf

1.3 download protobuf
  Download Link: https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases ##Source code (zip)##
  PS: recommend to download .tar.gz file, including ./configure file and no need to generate by ./autogen.sh command
  unpack the package, then cd to the directory
  
  $ cd protobuf
  $ ./autogen.sh   # if installation package is zip file, need to generate configure file, might fail as network block
                   # need to mannually download googletest package,  then unpack it, put it into gtest or googletest  
                   #file in build directory.
                   
  $ ./configure (--prefix=/usr)   # --prefix=/usr/..., put googletest files into directory, then ./autogen.sh again
  $ make
  $ make check     # protoc version, must match, pay attention to: ln -s source/dir  des/dir
                   # ISSUES happened: protobuf compiler version 3.7 doesn't match library version 3.5.0
                   # finally solved by compiling 3.5.0 protoc

  $ sudo make install  # libtool mismatch error, recreate aclocal.m4 with macros from libtool 2.4.6
                       # python virtual env: $ conda deactivate

2. ncnn compiling installation steps
  Link:  https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn/wiki/
  
  $ cd <ncnn-root-dir>
  $ mkdir -p build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..    # protocbuf version , pay attention to warning, it would be better if no warning
  $ make -j4    # issue: undefined references, gcc version might need to upgrade(5.5 test ok)
                # issue: compiling and ensure protobuf version

# (1) uninstall protocol buffer and install, Link: https://www.cnblogs.com/darkknightzh/p/5782992.html
# (2) install 3.5.0 version's protocbuf, Link: https://blog.csdn.net/FK2016/article/details/83375048
# (3) gcc upgrade and downgrade, Link: https://blog.csdn.net/betty13006159467/article/details/78394974
